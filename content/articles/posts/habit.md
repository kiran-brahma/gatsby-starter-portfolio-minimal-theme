A few habits that I learnt to change over the past few years that have paved for a improvement in my productivity.

### Exposure to Blue Light
<a href=" https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side" target="_blank">Blue Light</a> has been proven to impact sleep based on multiple studies. Sleep is single most factor that affects your productivity on a daily basis. It is advisable to get around 7-9 hours of sleep, so try avoiding your phone or tablet as far as possible an hour before your sleep. 

In case you do need to use them, enable the warm light mode to reduce impact as far as possible.

### Killing Time Online 

Our brains are not meant for multi-tasking, no matter what others may claim. We perform best when we focus on a singular task. One poor habit which I developed was reading random stuff or whiling my time online in midst of a work while justifying to self as a 5 min break. 

However, everytime I wanted to get back to my task at hand, it took me around 15-20 minutes to get my focus. Multiple studies have shown that our brain takes 15 mins to shift from one task to another, so its important to focus on task at hand than multi-tasking.

### Seeing your Phone during a conversation
Picking your phone in the midst of a conversation is rude to the other person, no matter the situation at hand. Try imaging self in same situation to visualise how rude it appears to others. 

Focus on the conversation at hand, allowing you to enjoy it all the more. Try using focus mode on your phone (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608" target="_blank">iOS</a> /<a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android/android-focus-mode/)" target="_blank">Android</a>) to avoid distractions. In case you do need to use the phone, communicate it to the other person to avoid appearing rude.

### Quick response to Notifications

Every time you divert your attention to respond to a notification, you lose 15-20 mintures of your productivity time for the task at hand. To avoid the braind drain, simply put all your phone motifications on silent mode by using the focus mode (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608" target="_blank">iOS</a> /<a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android/android-focus-mode/)" target="_blank">Android</a>). 

Seocndly, use the badge mode for emails and messages, allowing you to have a clean screen. In most situations, a notification doesn't need immediate response as the person would prefer to call if its really important than email or message you.

### Multi Tasking

The point doesnt need to be stressed enough any further as explained above. Focus on one task at a time, you will soon see a huge improvement in your productivity.

### Afraid to Say No

The ability to say "No" is highly underrated. Infact people respect those who say "No" than those who say Yes but fail to complete the task on time. Pick up the ability to say No as far as possible so that you can give your 100% for those who are committed to. 

Saying No avoids entangelments, allowing the other person to find someone else who can be a better fit. If its impossible to say No, learn to negotiate on whats possible and what's not to avoid future issues.

### Waiting for Perfect Opportunity

The majority of authors spend numerous hours developing their characters and stories, and some even create pages and pages of material they will never use in their finished works. They act in this way because they are aware that our ideas aren't perfect and our work could end up being bad, leading to avoid starting. 

However, if you don't get started and give your ideas time to develop, how can you possibly generate something amazing?

>You can edit a horrible page, but you can't edit a blank page - Jodi Picoult.

Focus more on starting and improving than waiting for perfectionism. I committed the same error when I wanted to start this blog, where I spent over 6 months on building content and layout than focussing to starting up quickly.

### Gossip

> Great minds discuss ideas, average ones discuss events and small minds discuss people.— Eleanor Roosevelt
 The above quote is self explainatory in itself. So learning to avoid gossiping but focussing more on engaging with people with an intent to learn than idling time on fruitless discussions

### Comparisions

There is always someone out there who is better than you. Similarly, you can be better than many others. It is an excercise in futility to compare self to others as then you start to define sucess on metrics that others have found value rather than yourself. 

Comparing yourself with others to understand where you can improve is a good habit but defining success via comparisions are futile. Self-worth always come from within.

Regardless of what people think of you at any particular moment, remmember that  
>you’re never as good or bad as they say you are.
