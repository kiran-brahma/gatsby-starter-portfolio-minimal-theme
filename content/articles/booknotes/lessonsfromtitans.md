Recently I finished reading [Lessons from the Titans](https://amzn.to/3TJoYDR) on my Kindle when I was travelling. The book is a well written collection of business case studies that got me thinking on so many aspects of business that I would certainly call this as a Must Read for anyone looking to pick up lessons. One of the biggest advantage the book was its ability to look at things from a long term perspective than short term that clouds most business books lately. I keep a notes and highlight key lessons from the book as I read so that I can use it for my reference in a future time. 

 I am sharing the notes I took when reading the book in this post

#### My Rating: 4.5 / 5

# Key Learnings 

### GE
#### Sucess Reasons
* Attack Cost base as its key to ensure tunraround
* Aggressive Internal and External Investment can be possible 
* Cash Flow is the best way to ensure you survive
* Link Incentives as per company focus
* Benchmarking and clear accountability are very important
* See what employee turnover is good for your business

#### Failure Reasons
* High Sucess leads to arrogance, which is default culture⁄
* Dont lose focus on Benchmarking and accountability of team
* Have small advisor group that plays a devil's advovacte when needed
* Capital should have clear focus on risk and return as often 
> Game Changing is often Game Over
* Going big to just meet sales targets rarely works
* Dont lose focus on operational aspecsts of business. Focus on Moonshot projects or big projects cant be main growth mantra. Lot of small things done properly also can provide same end result
* High foucs on Growth in EPS as in older era worked due to certain conditions. 


### Boeing
* Innovaition and growth may go hand in hand but once should keep in mind risk inherent 
* Success leads to arrogance which leads to downfall as observed in GE
* Innovation needs to focus on financial viability and not just focus on enginneering or disruption focus. 
* Dont let financial focus get in way of innovative ideas. Evalaute the ideas based on merit and risk
* Business Objectives need to change with time 
* Understand your ability to handle risk and stakeholders. If you are not the right person, pave way to another person who can handle it better

### Danaher
* Lean is a method that provides great results
* Let the people on ground take most of the decisions for quick turnaround than top down approach
* Small improvements done continously can lead to massive change with time. 1% daily improvement leads to 31.8X growth in a year. Small changes stack up quikcly and easy to implement
* Focus on making a process for every thing
* Tools are meant to help you focus and having focussed employees matters the most
* Humility, transparency and high expectations are best cultural traits to develop
* In today's world, financial complexity is high, so its important to have a strong finance person and you should be well versed on same
* Compounding should be the theme in every aspects of your business 
* Easier to improve margins in high margin product than in low margin. Customers find low value margin products low, so hard to improve margins
* Focus heavily on risk as one bad deal can override everything good done in one shot

### Honeywell
* As your business grows, compelxity and bureaucracy becomes the norm as it was evident in GE. Danaher focussed on lean, hence it avoided the same
* When things are bad, take the difficult and unpopular decisions at the earliest and dont avoid till last moment
* Focus on ensuring cost and liabilities are in proper control before shifting to growth mode
* Keep a tight leash on fixed cost. People hire people who hire more people, leading to unproductivity, which was evident in GE
* Pay people for what you expect them to do tomorrow and not just for today
* Local strategies yield better result than global ones

> **What you think, what you say and what you do should not be seperate decisions** 

### United Technologies
* Incetives drive organisational behavior. So ensure that they are adjusted and aligned as per changing times. Focus more that drive long term and systematic growth within organisations
* Don't underinvest for short term gains as it always leads to problems very quickly
* Feedback on whats wrong should be given high focus and people should feel open to air their views.

> **Intelligence is the ability to hold 2 extreme views on the issue**

### Caterpillar
* Market Volatality is inherent in most business. Forecasting for long term is not possible. GE made the same mistake of forecasting too long leading to wrong bets
* Tackle problems systematically and quickly rather than trying to solve all in one go
* There are no shortcuts to continous improvement. It needs to be a way of life and not a short term solution
* Outside perspective should be allowed to ensure that new challanges are faced better
* Important to ensure that employees at every level are engaged for changes and improvement
* Accountability and incentive structure are vital as seen in Danaher. Bad habits persists for long, so important to keep changing continously

### Roper
* Focus on few basic drivers of value and keep things simple
* Simple compensation scheme around profit and cash flow growth are best
* Some Niche Segments can have high marging but low priced, so you can use this to acquire companies
* Incremental cash returns on capital is important. Cash Flow is important and not accounting profit
* High margins and low working capital is a powerful combination
* Compounding works if you give it time in operations and finance
* Underinvestment in Sales and marketing and overinvestment in Product development and back office is general trend, which is bad for business

### TransDigm
* Even good business can be better
* Focus on your unique advantage and focus on maximizing them 
* Simple goals create focussed outcomes and complex ones lead to confusion
* Employees should be made to think and compensated as owners
* Pricing is a key lever than can be used to drive higher value in a falling market. Lower competition provides scope for increasing prices without any need to invest while focussing on keeping costs low
* Bottom-up management is far more effective than top-down GE

### Stanley Black & Decker
* Cost cutting is painful but is needed for survival
* Sustained focussed effort can transform and revive old business 
* Business Systems need to adopt to times and not be stuck in time when it was desgined. Every system has a life and it needs to adopt
* Accepting new ideas require openness, external networks, collaboration tools and repeatable process

## United Rentals
* Continous improvement are as important to service business as they are to manufacturing
* Developing an operational edge over others is very powerful in a hypercompetitive industry
* Incentives need to evolve as per needs of Organisations
* Employee feedback creates a viruous cycle, leading to great source of ideas
* Offloading assets outside doesnt remove asset from the equation but doing so leads to less control. Assets are still needed for busienss to operate. Uber may not own any cars but not owning any leads to complex challanges leading to multiple operational challanges, which in end dont provide any cost advantages


### General Learnings
* Growth Algo: Focus on investing business that provide sold returns, will lead to increment in profits faster than GDP. Profits will slowly rise to better than peers 
* Long term sucess is achieved if you focus on customer needs, treat suppliers as partners, employees as biggest assets and invest in communities
* Focus on what you can control in a culture: Fostering a humlbe culture, continous improvement, holding tight leash on costs, focus on service/product/manufacuting excellence and disciplined capital allocation focus that moves cash to high-return assets
* Business Benchmarking and systems keep you grounded to reality
* Sign of arrogance is the most common attribute of failure
