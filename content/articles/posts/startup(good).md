My personal experience while working in the Indian Startup ecosystem, based on my 4 years of working in Startups in the Taxi mobility space. I hope to share my view on what's good and bad about working in a fast growing startup.

## Part 1: The Good


## Why work in a Startup

### Context 

In the past few years, startups have grown exponentially, introducing us all to new innovations and ideas. Startups  they hire people from different backgrounds, especially young people. Even seasoned professionals choose to work in startups, especially from consulting. In the past few years, Startups have been the biggest employers for students across all premium engineering and MBA colleges. When personally hiring across such colleges, I could sense a keen interest from all students to work in a Startup as they provide with most people the right platform to learn multiple things in a short period that is very hard to come by in typical organisations

To anyone interested to explore opportunities, let me elucidate what one gains while working in a Startup


### Responsibility and Learning opportunities 

You are part of a small team from the start where your work approach and problem-solving ability paves the way for you. The learning curve is steep, wherein you are expected to grasp new concepts quickly and apply them without any delay. No matter what your level is in the team, you are expected to play active role, expected to deliver from day one.  

As a result, you becomes more accountable, dependable, adaptable, and eager to learn new things for advancement. You are able to operate effectively in a startup since employees are empowered to make decisions when necessary.

<h3> Business Exposure </h3>
You are exposed to difference facets of a business early on, allowing you to grasp what impact you have on the business quickly. Flexibility to explore other functions within a company is encouraged. This provides you with a long-term advantage as in today's time Generalists tend to find more sucess than specialists. (You can refer to this <a href="https://amzn.to/3wW52nn" target="_blank"> book</a> to understand more on this) 

<h3> Career Opportunities </h3>
Working for a startup offers excellent opportunity to take the initiative and lead, as your responsibilities scales along with the startup. Startups offer the great opportunity for young people with a thirst for experience to advance their career. 

Startup years are like dog years; there, one year is equivalent to seven elsewhere. The amount of learning I personally expereinced within one year was way beyond I could expect working in any large company within India. I worked in Jio for around a year and when I look at my first 3 months at TaxiFoSure, I could clearly see my learnings were almost 5X more.

<h3> Working with Smart People </h3>

Startups are filled with enthusiastic, motivated individuals who genuinely want to work there. Perhaps the nicest feeling you can havecan have at work is waking up each morning eager to tackle a new challenge. You are challanged on an intellectuall level, which was one of the biggest joy I personnaly felt during my time. The numerous debates and discussions help you in ways thats it can only be experienced.

Most startup founders are available for interaction on a regular basis in both formal and informal setting, helping you gain a broader perspective . When working in Jio, it was a major event whenever Mukesh Ambani used to visit the office but in a Startup, chatting with the founder over a cup of coffee is pretty normal.
