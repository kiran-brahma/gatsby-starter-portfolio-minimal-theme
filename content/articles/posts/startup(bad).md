Working in a startup presents a environment unlike any. Though it presents multiple advantages as I explained in my *[earlier post](/blog/posts/startupgood/)*, not eveything is as rosy at it appears on the outside.



## Part 2: The Bad

### Choatic Environment
Changes happen too quickly and many a times, based on investor feedback. The changes are implemented in a jiffy leaving most employees unsettled. The constant change in focus causes one to feel disillusioned easily. You are expected to deliver unrealistic results and failure to do so puts one on the backburner, leading to job insecurity every other day. As the startups mature, the fun in the workplace ends and it soons becomes a chaotic workplace where you are confused on whats happening and whether what you are working will just be cancelled in a moments notice. 

### Work Life Balance 

You are expected to put in long hours, which can range from 12-18 hours on a daily basis for 6-7 days a week. Trying to take time off form work is highly impossible as work loads just piles up that unless its an emergency, its hard to take time off for most people. Lately profit pressures have piled up on startups, it becomes more of a sweatshop nowadays than the informal ambiance that it was known for in the starting.

Lately there has been a trend of hiring expereinced people from large organisations, who bring in a culture shift in the workplace. Meetings soon become the norm which lasts more than an hour and then you are expected to finish your daily work before calling it a day. The long days with never ending meetings leads to heavy burnout, which is common across middle and higer management levels

### Work Environment

Though most people join a startup hearing stories of informal work culture that lets them dress casually and work at their convenience. Its a rare occurence unless the startup has developed a robus work culture and process. Very few startups have matured to this stage and within 2-3 years of operations, the culture become toxic in nature. 

In most cases, I have noticed that young employees who joined at very early stage lack the experience than employees who join later, often leading to ego clashes. These soon spreadt toxicity within the culture and leading to people just moving to other teams internally or to new organisations. Lately most startups have been pushed by investors to be operationally profitable, leading to drastic changes in their business model, leading to stressful work environment.


### Conclusion

Working in a Startup presents one with learning opportunities that are hard to find otherwise. In my personal opinion, if you are fine to deal with contstant change, I would recommend working for a duration of 2-3 years as this lays the foundation for better carre opportunities later on. The challanges you face in a startup are amplified when compared to working for regular MNC but in a way prepares you for what one should not do when facing similar situation. I would certainly recommend talking to few people to get a sense of the work culture of the organisation and even the team you will be joining as they will differ.
