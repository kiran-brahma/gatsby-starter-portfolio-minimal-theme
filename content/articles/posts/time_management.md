Nobody I know has ever been able to manage their time effectively at work without difficulty. 

- How do you manage a never ending inbox?
- How can you complete work when meetings take up most of your day? 
- How can you accomplish a to-do list that keeps growing?
- How can you even begin to find the time to create a list?

There are many misunderstandings about what time management really entails and how to execute it. Let us discuss about the most common ones that I have come across


### It's not about Time Management


Your primary focus has to be Productivity i.e. how much work can you finish in a given period of time than worrying about how much time is available. For Ex: If you pay attention to what emails need response from you and what can be ignored, you will notice a sudden improvement in time you take to go from a full inbox to inbox zero. One tip that I suggest is using of keywords and senders email to filter out emails that you can look at a later period.

You need to pay attention to how much workload you can take on and if you are clear on what your Productivity for different activities are, you will be able to plan your workload more effectively. In many workplaces, saying No can be tough but if you understand your workload, you can negotiate better than worry about never ending work


### System Focus 

Having a method to complete daily repetable tasks is certainly needed but too much focus on system leads to more issues than system solves. To help identify how to develop your own system, 
- Firstly [understand what time suits you best](https://www.sleepwatchapp.com/blog/on-the-nature-of-larks-owls-in-their-modern-habitat/). This will allow you plan better whether to start early or later as energy levels differ for every person.
- Secondly, experiment with different system but do keep in mind what will be sucess metrics. Once you find one, stick with it till the success metrics hold good
- Finally, discuss your approach with someome who you find manage their work and time better than you to see what learnings you can gather

### Dedicate Time for Change

Most people are too busy to even implement the systems they feel will imrpove their workload. You can adopt either of the 2 systems that I have found useful personally
- **Start Small** Dedicate 20-30 minutes weekly once to make small changes and stick with these for the week. This will result in habit formation and you can reopeat this till your entire system is in place
- **One Shot** If your situation is desperate, then take some days off to work a complete revamp of your work system. Make a detailed notes on the system process and follow it to the book till it becomes second nature

Ideally following first approach is more easy for most people and habits formed tend to stick for long as evident in the book [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/3eldmqs) (Do give this book a read if you havent yet)


### Work Context
A lot of what I explained above shows that you call the shots. However, we should remain aware that lot of systems or ideas are bound to fail within the context of your work place. Hence the key question to ask before starting is "How Can I be Productive with existing work rules". In many organisations, everything is urgent and needed now, so better to focus on saying No when possible as you never get time to build a system. It may also make sense to get your peers and managers to develop a system for entire team, ensuring better sucess than just focussing on solo efforts
