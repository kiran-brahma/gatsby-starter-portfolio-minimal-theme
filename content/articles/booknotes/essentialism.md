## Short Notes

- Your time is limited so important to ensure its spent effectively. Apply pareto principle to ensure optimum usage of time for the 80% work that matters
- Learn to say No. Committ only if you can give 100% else avoid. 
- Make tradeoff by elimiating things that are not as important as others. Learn to limit yourself to few choices
- Have a systematic process that lets you analyse your choicea and opportunity before committing to them
- If you made a mistake, accept it and move ahead to solve it. Dont try to fit a solution to a problem. 
- Dont give anything more weigthage than needed. Avoid [endowment effect bias](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/endowment-effect) to make proper decisions
- Understand [Sunk cost fallacy](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy). Focus energies on whats important now than what can be for future or what was in past. 


## Long Notes

- In life it's important that we focus on little that allows us to meet with great results rather than trying to do everything but with no success anywhere. For ex: if you have just 100 units of time, better to use it one good activity than trying to spread thin across multiple.

- One key lesson is the ability to say No and ability to make choice of what we want. If we don't make the choice, someone else will make the choice, rendering you useless . Hence very important that we retain the power of choosing and making our own decision

- It's important to realise the logic of where to put our efforts. Not all require our attention but only few need the focus from our side. You can apply the Pareto principle logic to asses your work. In simple terms, always question everything and consider them as nonessential. Doing this will allow you to arrive at what needs the real focus as power law applies (only few events results in exponential growth and focusing on many will mostly result in linear growth)

- Understand the value of trade off. When you want to do something, think whether or not it adds value to the end goal. It's important to have a process or a structure or framework that allows us to decide the trade off. It's impossible to do all so accept that sometimes you will miss a lot to do just one thing. Trying to do many will just result in a major fuckup. Think southwest and continental lite in low cost airlines. When faced with issues, just ask on what issue you would like to have and reject all other. Simply put, in life there are no solutions but just trade offs. So when faced with issue, just decide at that moment what's most important and go ahead rather than trying to make multiple decisions that lead to issues everywhere 

- It's important to spend lot of time to think on all possibilities and then go ahead with elimination. Hence you spend more time thinking and planning before executing. Important to do same as you will be going big on few ideas 

- One needs to take time out to process on what's happening around you. In today's hyper connected world, a timeout is only means to disconnect and focus on any activity. Simply put, just don't do anything but either read or think but try to schedule them on regular basis as this sets the tone on many aspects. It also provides you time to think on what matters and what don't. Ideally dedicate time in your calendar and during this phase, don't check email or phone or any message. Another idea can be to read some classics during this period to get your brain juices up and running. You can also make a list of questions that you wish to ponder over 

- Important for us to give time for play in life and not treat it as trivial. Play engages the part of the brain which assist us during creative thinking. Doing anything that u enjoy allows the release of stress immediately, which allows us to do things much better. Do anything u like on a periodical basis to allow us to keep our brain engaged. Play results in development of a more flexible approach, which helps us face the complexities of life 

- Sleep for 8 hours and sleep more on weekends. Sleep as much as you can, as it helps you in being more productive during the time you are up. There is no shortcut in relation to sleep. You neee it and suck it up and sleep 

- Very important to be very selective on what you will do and what you won't do. It's important to do the one thing good than doing many things at average level. A simple way to do this is scoring the idea or option on a scale of 100, if the option does not get a score above 90, reject it. Scolding is good as it forces you to think and not act on basis of gut instinct. 

- A systematic process can be that you write down the opportunity. Write down three min criteria that it needs to pass to be considered. Then in a final step, write down 3 extreme or ideal level criteria. An opportunity which passes all min and 2 out of the 3 extreme criteria should be taken up, remaining all needs to be junked. 

- Once you have review all options, simple ask the following question, " what will I say no to". Answering this will uncover your real priorities. Even ask this question, " if I did not have this, how much will I be willing to spend to have this"

- Always have a clear intent of what you want to do by having the following logic
> It should clearly state what we want to do, clarity on how we will measure success and timeline. For ex: 90% of Indians should be able to access internet by 2020. This is a clear statement and sets the ball rolling. When there is no clarity on what's needed, lot of time is wasted on political games, focused on short term goals that put personal interest over company goals

- Important to have clarity and make that one good decision as this allows team to focus on what they want to do and stop wasting time on useless areas

- When you are not interested in doing something, simply say no rather than being noncommittal. It can be said in a polite way but it's important that you say this with clear courage and clarity. Remember that every time you take on a project, you are sacrificing something else, so decide clearly. In case you are sure of rejection, then say it up front. Understand that the short term loss results in a long term respect, people learn to value your efforts. 

- Always be aware of the sunk cost bias that we tend to have. Despite best efforts, if you are clear that it won't be worth the effort then stop investing time into it and walk away. Cut your losses and move on. Apply the entrepreneurial thinking rather than the managerial thinking

- Be aware of the endowment affect, where you value a thing more than it's worth as you are the owner or team lead. Simply ask this question, " if I did own it or if I was not involved, how much will I be willing to pay or spend time to learn the skill or buy the product."

- We tend to fear waste. When faced with a situation of having to give up one of the two things, most of us give the cheaper option away by saying that if we are wasting money, let's waste the cheaper one. It not a good habit but focus on what matters more than looking at it on a economical value 

- When faced with a problem, admit you are wrong and proceed ahead as it's better than keeping up to massage ur ego

- Stop trying to force a fit when you notice that it's not working. To ensure that you are spending the best of your time, adopt the zero based budgeting, wherein you just say all commitments are off and build from scratch on what you want to do to ensure that you are doing the right thing. This also ensures that if something does not fit, we throw it away

- Don't make casual commitment, you are either fully in or fully out. If you feel something useless is running, then do a reverse pilot. Stop doing that activity and see if anyone misses it. If none notices the change, then simply stop doing it. Don't get too worried on fear of misssing out. Despite best efforts, you will have to miss a lot of things. 

- Important to keep editing out useless stuff when ever possible. Focus on always condensing everything into lowest possible form. If an email is 2 page long, see if it can be made one page and then half page and on till you rewalise that it can't be shortened than this anymore 

- Have clear defined boundaries and stick to them. If you don't want to work on a sat, then don't work. In the end, limits will result in the other person respecting you better than before. There may be short term losses but having these in places sets the right expectation 

- Always maintain buffer to ensure that you don't fault at the last moment. Prepare for the worst as it's the case in today's uncertain times. Extreme preparedness can be great as it allows you the luxury when things go bad or something unexpected happens 

- When you make a time estimate, add an extra 50% so that you are better off. This avoids all stress 

- Make scenario planning a part and parcel of your approach. Assess your risks before hand 

- Ask yourself these 5 questions
    - What risks do we face in this project 
    - What's the worst case scenario
    - What would be the social effects be when things go bad 
    - What's the financial impact of worst case
    - What investment to be done now to reduce risk and we are better of when worst case happens 

- Don't keep looking for a quick fix solution, rather try to find the constraints and fix that as it will lead to better results in overall improvement. Identifying the constraints will need you to have clarity on what you want and once when that is clear, you can remove the obstacles. 

- Always celebrate small wins rather than waiting for that one big win. Celebrating the small wins makes it worth it and keeps everyone motivated than waiting for that one big moment when we have done it all. Start small and small wins allow you to get the momentum for the big win. Focus on the min work needed to be done for the big win. Start working on that much ahead of deadline so that small progress keeps happening on a continual basis which results in a more stress free ending 

- Design a routine that you repeat daily so that it makes your execution effortless. Follow the routine so that execution happens easily when it matters the most. Having a clear routines results in focussed work and will appear easy. Execution will happen on auto pilot mode and there will be no need to worry 

- Focus on getting the usual day all sorted and focus on getting the hardest things solved at the start. Also make sure that you design a routine that allows you to function well. Have a separate day for specific focus and this way, in the entire week, you will touch base with all issues. Start with small cue to form habits and then make a routine rather than trying to do big changes 

- Focus on what's important this very moment rather than thinking on past or future. When you shift focus to enjoy this specific moment, you are able to get things done much faster than wasting energy on worrying about useless. When you feel you have lot of things on your plate, then just take a deep breath. Then list down all the things that need to be done. Then prioritise the list on the basis on what's important now and will allow me to get a good night sleep if completed. You can make multiple list on present issue, future issues or anything that you feel is important. Focus on the specific moment and you will be sorted. Your pace of execution will be much faster than you expect. Always take a deep breath to pause so that you can analyse the moment and have a better clarity on things
